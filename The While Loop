# When would you use a While...Loop?
# While loops are used when the execution of a command, or group of commands, will need to be repeated but the number of passes IS NOT KNOWN in advance!!!

print ("This program will explore how the While Loop works.\n")

print("Objective: \n") 
print("Write a loop that starts at the last character in the string \nand works its way backwards to the first character in the string.\n")
print("The program will print each letter on a seperate line, except backwards.\n")

MyWord = input("Please enter a word: \n")

print("\n")

length = len(MyWord)
# For example, let's say we choose the word Storm. 
# There are 5 letters in the word Storm. 
# So, we have set the variable length equal to a value of 5. 


# However, a string is a sequence of characters and those characters 
# start at position 0, not position 1! 
# So, S is index position 0, t is index position 1, etc. 

index = 0

while index < len(MyWord):
	LastLetter = MyWord[length-1]
	print(LastLetter)
	length = length-1
	index = index+1

# Alright, so we start at the beginning of the loop. 
# We will again choose the word Storm for this example.
# As a reminder, the variable length has a value of 5.

# index is currently = 0, and len(MyWord) = 5
# Since 0 < 5, the loop will execute.

# Alright, so the variable LastLetter is equal to the last character 
# in the string MyWord and has an index value of 5-1 or 4. The character m 
# will print.

# The next piece of code, length = length-1, will now set the value of the variable 
# length = 4. 

# The value of the variable index is increased by 1. So, the value is now equal to 1.
