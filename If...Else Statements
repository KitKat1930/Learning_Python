# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b
# These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

# An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
# The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
# The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

A = input("Please enter a number for Variable A: \n")

B = input("Please enter a different number for Variable B: \n")

if A > B:
	print(" Variable A is greater than Variable B!")
else:
	print ("Variable A is less than Variable B!")
