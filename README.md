# Learning Python
This repository will contain information on how to code in the computer programming language of Python! 


## **Steps to Setting Up Your First Python Program!!!!**

### **I.	Install Python**
    - In my example, I installed Python 2.7.2


Environment Setup
    - Why do we need to set up the Environment?
    
        •	“Python” is the name of the interpreter for the Python programming language. 
        •	python.exe interpreter is present inside Python installation directory, usually in Program Files
        •	Hence, we need to tell the Operating System about the Python interpreter


### **II.	SET UP**

•	Go to the directory where python.exe file is present
      - Mine was:
                  C:\Program Files\Python27
                  
•	Copy this location from the address bar

•	Now go to the System properties

•	Click on Advanced System Settings

•	Click on Environment Variables

•	Under user variable, click on New…

•	Give variable name

    - I chose PATHPYTHON27;
    
    - Add a Semicolon to the existing value
    
    - Then paste the copied location
    
    - C:\Program Files\Python27
    
•	Then click OK, OK, OK….


### **III.	Verify that the Python Interpreter was installed properly** 

•	Set up a folder on your Desktop 

    - I named my folder “Python Programs”
    
•	Double click on the folder

•	In the address bar type “cmd” and hit ENTER         

•	You should see a window pop up that looks like the following image:             

 

## **Set Up First Program (“Script File”) with Notepad!!!**


Type in the following: “notepad Second.py”

A box will pop up and will say the following “Cannot find the Second.py file. Do you want to create a new file?” 
   - Click “Yes"

Within notepad type the following: 
  - print("Hello World!")

Save the document and close 

Back in your command window, type the following: “python Second.py”

The program should run and the messsage 'Hello World!' should print in your command window!
