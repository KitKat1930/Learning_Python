# When would you use a For Loop?
# For loops are used when the execution of a command, or group of commands, will need to be repeated a predetermined number of times!!!
# The for loop does not require an indexing variable to be set beforehand in python! 


print ("This program will explore how the For Loop works.\n")

print("Objective: \n") 
print("Write a loop that starts at the first character in a string.")
print("The loop will print each letter on a seperate line.")
print("The loop will continue to print each character in the string until there are no characters left.")

MyWord = input("Please enter a word: \n")

print("\n")

for x in MyWord:
	print(x)

# So what's happening here? 

# Each time through the loop, the next character in the string is 
# assigned to the variable x. The loop will continue until no
# characters are left.
